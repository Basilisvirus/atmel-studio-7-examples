# atmel-studio-7-examples
Examples on how to use atmel studio on atmega328p microcontroller, using AVR C Library

By making these examples i assume that you already know how to write assembly code on any microcontroller (i learned to write on 8051 microcontroller before i started studying avr C to write on atmega micro controller)

Notes: 
*If you get toolchain error while building or opening a project, download avr toolchain from their website and install in on your computer.

*Download doxygen via tools/extensions & updates. It will be installed on:
